    description: <div><p>As a part of my Bachelor studies, with a team of 7 students, I built a command line interface in Rust.
      It allows students to test and submit their programming exercises using the TestMyCode system of the University.</p>
    <p>I implemented many core features of the application and planned the basic architecture of the code, to allow integration and unit testing. I did not know Rust before, but I learned it for this project.</p>
    <p>The application is still used.</p>
